WHERE DID YOU GROW UP?  WHAT WAS YOUR ACADEMIC PATH?
I grew up in El Cerrito, which is literally a 10-minute BART ride away from
campus (long trek from home, I know). I went to El Cerrito High, and from there
went to Berkeley in Fall of 2010, which is also when I took the OG (or "first
ever,"  if you're not hip with the lingo) CS10 course! I came in undeclared in
L&S (heading towards an English route oddly enough), but after I took CS10, I
got hooked into programming, and am now a declared Computer Science Major!

HOW MUCH PROGRAMMING HAVE YOU DONE?  WHAT LANGUAGES?
My first language was Scratch/BYOB when I took CS10. After that I learned Scheme
and Java, and C which I learned in CS61a and CS61b  and CS61c
respectively I learned a lot of web development languages

over summer at my internship, so I've gotten fairly good at
JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, and Node.js.

I also know a decent amount of UNIX. Currently, I'm learning Python
and Ruby, and am

becoming more familiar with the aforementioned web development languages.


WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES?
I love to swim (did it competitively for 10 years!), discover new bands to
listen to, play guitar, and try random restaurants!

WHAT ARE SOME OF YOUR TALENTS AND SKILLS?
Again, swimming is a big one. I made it to NCS and Far Westerns senior year of
high school, and had previously competed in the Junior Olympics. Guitar has been
something I picked up more recently, but it's my favorite way to relax. I can
also wiggle my ears.


HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING REMARKABLE?
At my internship this past summer, i built a website from the ground
up using Node.js (server side JavaScript),

JavaScript, jQuery, HTML5 and CSS3. We also hooked it up to APIs for
Blogger, Twitter, and Google Calenders so that

the person maintaining the site only needed to know how to write blog
posts to update it. The website also automatically changes

its layout based on your screen size, so you can view it easily on a
phone, tablet, and monitor.

Also, I survived (and did pretty well in) CS61b with Professor Paul Hilfinger.


WHAT COMMITMENTS WILL BE CONSUMING YOUR CYCLES THIS TERM?
In addition to being a reader for CS10, some of the classes I'll be taking
include CS188(AI), CS186 (Databases), and Social Implications of
Computing. I'll also be doing working on human-centered design
projects in Berkeley Innovation,
leading the Student Commuters at Cal club as Co-President and Web Developer, and
keeping Berkeley up to date with music as the Lead Music Critic for the Daily
Californian! Looks like a fun semester!
