Where did you grow up? What was your academic path?

I grew up in the Heart of Silicon Valley that is San Jose, California. I went to Santa Clara High School (I was close to the border of San Jose/Santa Clara). I am now a 3rd year Environmental Economics & Policy major.

How much programming have you done (& what languages)?

When I got to Cal, I had absolutely no programming experience at all. I took CS10 in Fall 2011, CS61A in Spring 2012, CS61B in Fall 2012, and currently CS61C. So I have had some experience coding in BYOB, Python, Scheme, and Java. I hope to learn the C programming language this semester.

What are your hobbies?

My hobbies include playing video games (preferably on the PS3), watching anime, reading manga, doing photography, bowling, gokart racing, and hanging out with my friends. Also love watching hockey…so glad that the lockout is over! GO SHARKS!

What are some of your talents & skills?

I'm generally good about troubleshooting computers, and have a little bit of graphic design skills. The best talent I have is probably is my willingness to help. I love helping others and finding solutions together with others.

Have you done anything remarkable? Has anything really memorable happened to you?

I met Bill Nye the Science Guy while volunteering at the Tech Museum in San Jose and got a photo of him and me. He's a really nice person and definitely willing to talk and meet fans who watched his videos in elementary and middle school.

What commitments will be consuming your cycles this term?

I'm taking EEP C101, EEP 153, and CS61C. Also, I am working in the Graduate Division as a PC Support person. I will lab assist for both of Aijia's CS10 sections. I might also drop into other sections if time permits. This semester will be challenging and hopefully fun at the same time :)
